Hello! I'm Alley Hector, a designer, developer, software engineer, content curator and writer. This diverse skill set allows me to help my clients connect and engage with their audience on any platform.

Your website structure, social media and online content must work together to showcase who you really are. I can help you craft clear messaging and develop a dynamic and engaging online presence.

Whether you aren't sure where to start, want to rebrand, or know you need something but not sure what that something is - I can help you every step of the way. I work with private companies, nonprofits, activists and artists I believe in. I'm not just a designer/writer/nerd for hire. When I work with clients, I help them develop strategies for long term success.

A [Smith College](https://www.smith.edu/) grad based in my hometown Portland, OR, I love the Pacific Northwest. But I am also a traveler and enjoy working with clients all over the world. I am as at ease working across time zones as I am riding through my neighborhood on my All-City Space Horse road bike.

Here are a few technologies and skills I work with regularly:
