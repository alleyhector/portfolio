Hello! I'm Alley Hector, a designer, developer, software engineer and content curator and creator who specializes in making your online presence reflect who you truly are. Who you are, your core values as a nonprofit, activist, artist, progressive, your message is what matters. I work with causes I believe in so I know how important it is that these come across. 

You need a good team to create your website, your content, and manage your social media and how your message reaches your customers, your clients. I am able to apply technical and writing knowledge to any of these one areas, but more importantly, I know how they should all fit together. So whether you don't know where to start, you want to rebrand or you want to craft or re-craft any portion of what you or your company serve to the world, I can be with you every step of the way.

A graduate of [Smith College](https://www.smith.edu/), I am now based in my own hometown of Portland, OR. I am a local through and through and love to sing the praises of the Pacific Northwest, but I am also a traveler and enjoy working with clients all over the world. As a freelancer for the last several years I am as at ease working across time zones as I am riding down my neighborhood street on my little silver Allcity Space Horse road bike.

Here are a few technologies and skills I work with regularly:
