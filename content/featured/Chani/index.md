CHANI, so named for the inimitable queer astrolger Chani Nicholas, is a feminist led astrological app and podcast focused self-discovery, mindfulness, and healing. Here I steered the technology department, edited content, and produced our [podcast](https://chaninicholas.com/astrology-podcast/). Our product line included [mobile applications](https://app.chani.com/), [e-commerce](https://chanishop.com/), a [news & educational site](https://chani.com/), React based [web chart tool](https://chart.chaninicholas.com/), astrological mathemathics API and other technological tools designed to bring the user into self actualization.
