I was part of a team that worked on a redesign for local Portland-based reclaimed woodworkers Salvage Works. We redesigned layouts and organized their photography to make sure to properly showcase their Pacific Northwest hand-deconstructed lumber furniture pieces. We also updated and and streamlined their Shopify-driven product pages and blog.
