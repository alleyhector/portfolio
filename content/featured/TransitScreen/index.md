TransitScreen (now ActionFigure) needed a way to showcase its real-time transportation products and help customers make more sustainable commuting choices. Leading a team that worked closely with marketing, I built a Node.js web application from the ground up, displaying live data and user-based mapping for products like the original [TransitScreen](https://actionfigure.ai/screen/), [mobile solutions](https://actionfigure.ai/mobile/), [MobilityScore](https://actionfigure.ai/mobilityscore/) and more.
