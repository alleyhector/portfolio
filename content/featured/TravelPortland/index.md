Travel Portland, a promoter and steward of an evolving city and its progressive values, has the power to transform the travelers who visit. During their much-needed complete website overhaul I help craft content and layout making sure to their most relevant content was front and center. Copywriting and editing tasks for feature and topic articles made landing pages such as [food](https://www.travelportland.com/culture/food/), [biking](https://www.travelportland.com/culture/biking/), and [cultural communities](https://www.travelportland.com/culture/cultural-communities/) shine. I revamped the entire [LGBTQ section](https://www.travelportland.com/culture/lgbtq-plus/) and wrote updated content from a community standpoint.
