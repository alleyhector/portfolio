Created bike share websites for systems across the US operated by Alta Bike Share, which then became Motivate Bike Share, then Lyft. Although the sites have since been updated I created, built, miantained and integrated docking system technologies for various city systems including [Citibike](https://www.citibikenyc.com/) in New York city, [Capital Bikeshare](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/) in DC, and [Bay Area Bike Share](https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels) (now Ford GoBike) in SF in addition to various related projects such as Citibike for Good.
