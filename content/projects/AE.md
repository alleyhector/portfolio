Regular contributor (before it was bought out and went downhill) to one of the first queer women's websites on the internet, [After Ellen](https://www.afterellen.com/author/alley-hector). Examples of the arts & culture pieces I penned include a [Gender Outlaws book review](https://www.afterellen.com/more/79376-gender-outlaws-the-next-generation-gives-us-an-update), an [interview with Lady Gaga video star Heather Cassils](https://www.afterellen.com/general-news/70193-an-interview-with-heather-cassils) or a [list of the most powerful lesbians in politics](https://www.afterellen.com/more/71618-rachel-maddow-tops-the-list-of-most-powerful-lesbians-in-politics).
