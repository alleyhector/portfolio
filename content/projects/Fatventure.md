Contributed to the inaugural issue of a print magazine, [_Fatventure_](https://web.archive.org/web/20181005191533/http://www.fatventuremag.com/issue-1/contributors/) dedicated to active lifestyles beyond the boundaries of weight-loss culture. As a cyclist of size it can be intimidating to get into bike touring so my [tips for getting started](./work/Fatventure-excerpt.pdf) (which I have included here in a PDF excerpt of the publication) are also [chronicled in my travel blog Out & About](https://outandabout.space/2018/11/05/fatventure-magazine-is-here/).
