PM Press specializes in academic countercultural anthologies and I was asked to contribute to [_Sticking It to the Man: Revolution and Counterculture in Pulp and Popular Fiction, 1950 to 1980_](https://www.pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1012). My piece, [_The Odd Girlsâ€™ Journey Out of the Shadows_](https://www.academia.edu/6544839/The_Odd_Girls_Journey_Out_of_the_Shadows_Lesbi-Pulp_Novels_and_the_Creation_of_a_Lesbian_Discourse) chronicles female authored lesbi-pulp novels and the creation of a lesbian discourse pre Stonewall.
