We gathered in the Literary Kitchen to experiment. What might happen if we married the occult with the creative? Here is the result, a [They Were Never So Unconcerned](./work/MagicalZine-excerpt.pdf) short story based on a tarot spread, excerpted from writer [Ariel Gore's](https://literarykitchen.net/sample-page/) Magical Writing Zine.
