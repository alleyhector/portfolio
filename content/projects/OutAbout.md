A blog I started primarily to showcase my bike touring, and most specifically my monthlong trip from Paris to Amsterdam and back, Out & About has become a more general travel publication. The main feature here is the writing but I also manage all the technical and design aspects of this Gutenburg updated Wordpress website.
