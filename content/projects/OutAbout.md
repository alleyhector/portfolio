A blog I started primarily to showcase my bike touring, and most specifically my monthlong trip from Paris to Amsterdam and back, [*Out & About*](https://www.outandabout.space/) has become a more general travel publication. The main feature here is the writing but I also manage all the technical and design aspects of this Gutenburg updated Wordpress website.
