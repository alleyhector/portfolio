Portland Sees Popups Replace the E Room -- A rich LGBT watering hole history, the last lesbian bar’s betrayal, and thoughts on the current landscape of queer women’s parties and spaces — a dramatic tale of Portland, Oregon bar culture. In Autostraddle’s The [State of the Lesbian Bar](https://www.autostraddle.com/tag/the-state-of-the-lesbian-bar/), we’re taking a look at lesbian bars around the country as the possibility of extinction looms ever closer.
