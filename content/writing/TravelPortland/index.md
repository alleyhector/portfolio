Travel Portland is a promoter and steward of an evolving city and its progressive values, which have the power to transform the travelers who visit. Here I managed content during the transition to a new site with a focus on layout and copywriting and editing of feature and topic articles and editorial decision making for landing pages such as [food](https://www.travelportland.com/culture/food/), [biking](https://www.travelportland.com/culture/biking/), and [cultural communities](https://www.travelportland.com/culture/cultural-communities/). Revamped the entire [LGBTQ section](https://www.travelportland.com/culture/lgbtq-plus/) and wrote updated content.
